# Room Reservation System

## Overview

Room Reservation System is a full-stack web application designed to manage room booking processes with structured validation and approval workflows. The system enables users to create reservation requests, validates potential scheduling conflicts, and supports administrative approval logic.

The project demonstrates modular backend architecture, RESTful service design, and frontend integration within a structured full-stack environment.

## System Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

- `room_reservation` – Backend application built using Java and Spring Boot  
- `room_reservation_fe` – Frontend application built using modern web technologies  

The architecture follows separation of concerns principles, clearly dividing presentation, business logic, and data access layers.

### Backend

The backend application provides:

- REST API endpoints for reservation management  
- Business logic for validation and approval workflows  
- Conflict detection for overlapping reservations  
- Structured entity modeling and database interaction  
- Modular architecture with clear layer separation  

### Frontend

The frontend application provides:

- User interface for submitting and managing reservation requests  
- Interaction with backend REST endpoints  
- Structured data presentation and validation feedback  

## Key Features

- Creation and management of room reservations  
- Approval workflow for administrative validation  
- Prevention of time conflicts through server-side validation  
- RESTful API design  
- Layered backend architecture  
- Integration between frontend and backend components  

## Technologies Used

Backend:
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- REST APIs  
- SQL and relational database concepts  

Frontend:
- JavaScript  
- Modern frontend framework architecture  
- API integration  

Version Control:
- Git  
- GitHub  

## Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a structured reservation management system that demonstrates backend validation logic, layered system architecture, and frontend integration.

The system focuses on data consistency, validation mechanisms, and maintainable code structure suitable for real-world organizational environments.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Full-stack system design  
- REST API development  
- Backend validation and workflow logic  
- Database integration and data modeling  
- Conflict detection algorithms  
- Modular and scalable application architecture  

This project reflects practical experience in developing structured web systems that combine backend reliability with frontend usability.
